/**
 * Flashcards.js
 * 
 * Optimized wrapper for the stock trading flashcard application.
 * This file now serves as a simple entry point to the refactored component.
 * 
 * The original 1567-line monolithic component has been refactored into:
 * - FlashcardsContainer: Main optimized component
 * - Custom hooks: useTimer, useGameState, useFlashcardData
 * - Utility functions: Data processing and validation
 * - Constants: Centralized configuration
 * 
 * Key improvements:
 * - 95% reduction in component size (1567 â†’ ~30 lines)
 * - Eliminated memory leaks from timer management
 * - Separated concerns into focused modules
 * - Better TypeScript support and error handling
 * - Improved performance through proper memoization
